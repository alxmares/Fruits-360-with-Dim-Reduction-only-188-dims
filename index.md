## üîΩ Dimensionality Reduction

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

To tackle the challenge of high-dimensional data, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** was employed to reduce the number of dimensions from **30,000** (representing each pixel in a 100x100x3 image) to just **188**. This substantial reduction not only decreases computational complexity but also helps prevent overfitting, enhancing the model‚Äôs generalization ability.

- **Original Dimensions**: 30,000 (100x100x3)
- **Reduced Dimensions**: 188
- **Purpose**: Minimize data redundancy while preserving as much variability as possible, ensuring the essential features of the images are retained.
